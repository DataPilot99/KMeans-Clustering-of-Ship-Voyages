# KMeans-Clustering-of-Ship-Voyages
This code builds a K-Means clustering model that helps classify voyages into different performance groups - such as cost-efficient, high-revenue, underperforming

### Background

A logistics company manages a diverse fleet of ships transporting goods across various routes. Despite access to detailed operational data, the management lacks clarity on which types of voyages are cost-effective, which need optimization, and how operational patterns relate to ship performance.

### Business Problem

The task is building a K-Means clustering model that helps classify voyages into different performance groups - such as cost-efficient, high-revenue, underperforming, etc. These insights will help the business:

Reduce operational inefficiencies

Adjust cargo distribution and route planning

Recommend ship-specific improvements

Make data-driven decisions on engine types, routes, and maintenance
